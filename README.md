# JWST-Hubble-Planet-projections

This code allows us to create polar, stereographic and equatorial projections for the images from winjupos. Along with the projections and the merged results of various projections, the code outputs the correct navigation of latitude and longitude, along with the central meridian longitude and c=the centered longitude based on the Central Meridian (only for Jupiter).

Lambert corrections will be added soon.
